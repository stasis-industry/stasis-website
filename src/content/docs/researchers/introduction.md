title: Introduction to MAFIS
description: What MAFIS is, why lifelong fault resilience matters, and how to get started.
---

**MAFIS** (Multi-Agent Fault Injection Simulator) is a **fault resilience observatory** for lifelong multi-agent path finding (MAPF). It measures how multi-agent systems degrade, recover, and adapt under real-world conditions — faults, congestion, and cascading failures — sustained over continuous operation.

MAFIS is a research project built in Rust using the Bevy engine, compiled to both WebAssembly (browser) and native desktop. It runs deterministic simulations where every fault event, cascade, and recovery is reproducible from a seed.

## The Research Question

> *Does performance in ideal conditions predict resilience under faults?*

A system that performs "worse" in perfect conditions may be "better" under sustained fault injection. MAFIS produces the evidence to prove or disprove this for different combinations of scheduler strategy, topology, and fault intensity.

## Research Variables

| Variable | Options |
|---|---|
| **Scheduler strategy** | Random, Closest-first |
| **Fault intensity** | Off / Low / Medium / High |
| **Grid topology** | Warehouse (S/M/L), Open Floor, Custom |
| **Solver** | PIBT, RHCR (3 variants), Token Passing |

The solver is typically held constant while the other variables are swept. The primary insight MAFIS is built to reveal: **scheduler strategy — not solver algorithm — determines fault resilience.**

## Resilience Scorecard

Every fault injection run produces a four-metric **Resilience Scorecard**:

- **Fault Tolerance** — how much throughput is retained under faults (Milner 2023)
- **NRR** — operational uptime ratio: recovery speed vs fault frequency (Or 2025)
- **Adaptability** — does the system redistribute traffic after a fault
- **Critical Time** — fraction of time spent in a critically degraded state (Ghasemieh 2024)

See [Resilience Scorecard](/docs/researchers/observatory/resilience-scorecard) for formulas and examples.

## Two Versions

| | Web (WASM) | Desktop (Native) |
|---|---|---|
| **Install** | None — runs in browser | Download binary |
| **Performance** | 500 agents, 60 FPS | 1000+ agents, parallel computation |
| **Interface** | HTML/CSS/JS controls | Full Egui panel system |
| **Use case** | Quick experiments, demos | Batch experiments, parameter sweeps |

Both versions share the same simulation core. Same seed = identical results.

A **CLI tool** (`mafis`) is also available for headless batch experiments and scripted parameter sweeps without any graphical interface.

## What MAFIS Is NOT

> [!WARNING] **Not a solver benchmark.** MAFIS does not compare algorithms against each other. Algorithm comparisons are [MAPF Tracker](https://tracker.pathfinding.ai/)'s domain.

> [!WARNING] **Not a static testbed.** For standardized 2D grid environments, see [MovingAI MAPF Benchmarks](https://movingai.com/benchmarks/mapf.html).

> [!WARNING] **Not a one-shot simulator.** MAFIS measures degradation under continuous operation, not time-to-completion for a fixed set of goals.
