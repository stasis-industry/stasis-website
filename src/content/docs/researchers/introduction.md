title: Introduction to MAFIS
description: What MAFIS is, why lifelong fault resilience matters, and how to get started.
---

**MAFIS** (Multi-Agent Fault Injection Simulator) is a **fault resilience observatory** for lifelong multi-agent path finding (MAPF). It measures how multi-agent systems degrade, recover, and adapt under faults, congestion, and cascading failures sustained over continuous operation.

MAFIS is a research project built in Rust using the Bevy engine, compiled to both WebAssembly (browser) and native desktop. It runs deterministic simulations where every fault event, cascade, and recovery is reproducible from a seed.

## The Research Question

> *What happens to a multi-agent fleet under sustained fault injection?*

Different solvers, fault types, and topologies produce different degradation and recovery patterns. MAFIS makes those differences observable and measurable.

## Research Variables

| Variable | Options |
|---|---|
| **Solver** | PIBT, RHCR-PBS, Token Passing |
| **Fault type** | Burst, Wear-based (Weibull), Spatial zone outage, Intermittent |
| **Grid topology** | Warehouse Medium, Warehouse Large, Compact Grid, Kiva Warehouse, Sorting Center, Fulfillment Center |
| **Agent density** | Configurable (up to 1,000 agents in WASM, 5,000 native) |
| **Scheduler strategy** | Random, Closest |

MAFIS is built to study how solver architecture, fault type, and topology interact under sustained fault conditions.

## Resilience Scorecard (Live Observatory)

Interactive MAFIS sessions display a real-time **Resilience Scorecard** with four indicators:

- **Fault Tolerance (FT)** — throughput retained under faults
- **NRR** — operational uptime ratio, recovery speed vs fault frequency (requires recurring faults)
- **Survival Rate** — fraction of the initial fleet still alive after faults
- **Critical Time (CT)** — fraction of time spent in a critically degraded state

See [Resilience Scorecard](/docs/researchers/observatory/resilience-scorecard) for formulas and examples.

## Six Primary Experiment Metrics

Batch experiment runs (headless, reproducible) report six differential metrics designed for cross-configuration comparison:

| Metric | What it measures |
|---|---|
| **Fault Tolerance (FT)** | Throughput retention ratio vs fault-free baseline |
| **Critical Time (CT)** | Fraction of post-fault ticks below 50% baseline |
| **ITAE** | Time-weighted integral of throughput error — penalizes slow recovery |
| **Attack Rate (AR)** | Fraction of fleet ever killed or cascade-affected by any fault |
| **Cascade Depth** | Mean BFS depth on the ADG across all fault events |
| **Rapidity** | Ticks to ≥90% baseline throughput for 5 consecutive ticks (recoverable faults only) |

See [Fault Metrics](/docs/researchers/metrics/fault-metrics) for formulas, examples, and research origins.

## Two Versions

| | Web (WASM) | Desktop (Native) |
|---|---|---|
| **Install** | None (runs in browser) | Download binary |
| **Performance** | 1,000 agents, 60 FPS | 5,000 agents, parallel computation |
| **Interface** | HTML/CSS/JS controls | Full Egui panel system |
| **Use case** | Quick experiments, demos | Batch experiments, parameter sweeps |

Both versions share the same simulation core. Same seed = identical results.

A **CLI tool** (`mafis`) is also available for headless batch experiments and scripted parameter sweeps without any graphical interface.

## What MAFIS Is NOT

> [!WARNING] **Not a solver benchmark.** MAFIS does not compare algorithms against each other. Algorithm comparisons are [MAPF Tracker](https://tracker.pathfinding.ai/)'s domain.

> [!WARNING] **Not a static testbed.** For standardized 2D grid environments, see [MovingAI MAPF Benchmarks](https://movingai.com/benchmarks/mapf.html).

> [!WARNING] **Not a one-shot simulator.** MAFIS measures degradation under continuous operation, not time-to-completion for a fixed set of goals.
