title: Resilience Scorecard
description: Four research-backed metrics that characterize how a multi-agent system behaves under sustained faults — Fault Tolerance, NRR, Adaptability, and Critical Time.
---

The **Resilience Scorecard** is computed live during the fault injection phase. It distills raw metrics into four research-backed indicators that together answer: *is this system resilient, degrading, or collapsing?*

```
RESILIENCE SCORECARD
  Fault Tolerance    0.82
  NRR                0.91
  Adaptability       0.64
  Critical Time      0.15

  Composite Score    0.80  →  RESILIENT
```

## 1. Fault Tolerance (FT)

*How much throughput does the system retain under faults?*

$$FT = \frac{P_{\text{fault}}}{P_{\text{nominal}}}$$

| Variable | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $P_{\text{fault}}$ | Average throughput during fault injection |
| $P_{\text{nominal}}$ | Baseline throughput (fault-free) |

- **Range:** 0 (no throughput under faults) → 1+ (throughput matches or exceeds baseline)
- **Weight in composite:** 30%

**Origin:** Adapted from Milner (2023), *"Quantifying Fault Tolerance in Autonomous Multi-Robot Systems"* — defines fault tolerance as the ratio of degraded performance to nominal performance.

**Real-life example:** A warehouse fleet delivers 100 packages/hour normally. Under faults, it delivers 82/hour. FT = 0.82. A fleet manager uses this to decide: "Can I absorb a 3-robot failure during peak hours without missing SLAs?"

> [!TIP] **Animation concept:** Two throughput bars side by side — a tall "baseline" bar and a shorter "under faults" bar. The ratio between them fills a gauge labeled "Fault Tolerance."

## 2. NRR — Normalized Recovery Ratio

*How much time does the system spend recovering versus operating?*

$$NRR = 1 - \frac{MTTR}{MTBF}$$

| Variable | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $MTTR$ | Mean Time To Recovery (ticks to resume after a fault) |
| $MTBF$ | Mean Time Between Faults (ticks between fault events) |

- **Range:** 0 (always recovering) → 1 (recovers instantly relative to fault frequency)
- **Weight in composite:** 25%
- **Requires** at least 2 fault events to compute.

**Origin:** Or (2025), *"MTTR-A: Measuring Cognitive Recovery Latency in Multi-Agent Systems"* — defines NRR as the uptime bound, proving that steady-state operational fraction satisfies $\pi_{up} \geq NRR$.

**Real-life example:** If a fleet takes 10 ticks to recover and faults occur every 100 ticks, NRR = 0.90 — the fleet is operational 90%+ of the time. If recovery takes 50 ticks with faults every 60 ticks, NRR = 0.17 — the fleet is almost always recovering and rarely productive.

> [!TIP] **Animation concept:** A timeline with alternating green (operational) and red (recovering) segments. The ratio of green to total fills a gauge labeled "NRR." High NRR = mostly green.

---

## 3. Adaptability

*Does the system redistribute traffic after a fault?*

$$A = \frac{H(t)}{H_{\max}}$$

| Variable | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $H(t)$ | Shannon entropy of heatmap density at tick $t$ |
| $H_{\max}$ | Maximum possible entropy: $\ln(\text{walkable cells})$ |

- **Range:** 0 (all agents stuck in one area) → 1 (perfectly distributed across the grid)
- **Weight in composite:** 25%

**Origin:** Shannon entropy as a spatial distribution measure is standard in information theory. Applied here to measure whether agents redistribute to alternative routes after a fault blocks their primary path.

**Real-life example:** A delivery corridor is blocked. If all robots queue behind the blockage (low entropy), the system is not adaptive. If they spread to alternative corridors (high entropy), throughput recovers faster. A fleet operator asks: "Will my system reroute or jam?"

> [!TIP] **Animation concept:** A grid heatmap. Before fault: agents clustered in corridors (hot spots). After fault: heat spreads across the grid as agents find new routes. An entropy gauge rises from low to high.

## 4. Critical Time (CT)

*How much time does the system spend in a critical state?*

$$CT = \frac{t_{\text{below}}}{t_{\text{fault}}}$$

| Variable | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $t_{\text{below}}$ | Ticks where throughput < 50% of baseline |
| $t_{\text{fault}}$ | Total ticks since first fault |

- **Range:** 0 (never critical) → 1 (always critical)
- **Weight in composite:** 20% (inverted: $1 - CT$)
- **Threshold:** 50% of baseline throughput

**Origin:** Adapted from Ghasemieh (2024), *"Transient Analysis of Fault-Tolerant Systems"* — uses time-below-threshold as a measure of system criticality during transient degradation.

**Real-life example:** After a cascade failure, throughput drops to 30% of baseline for 45 out of 300 ticks. CT = 0.15. A reliability engineer asks: "How often is my system dangerously degraded?" CT = 0.15 means "only 15% of the time" — acceptable. CT = 0.60 means "more often than not" — redesign needed.

> [!TIP] **Animation concept:** A throughput curve over time with a dashed red line at 50% baseline. The segments below the line flash red. CT = the red fraction of the total timeline.

## Composite Score

The four metrics combine into a single resilience score:

$$\text{Score} = 0.30 \times FT + 0.25 \times NRR + 0.25 \times A + 0.20 \times (1 - CT)$$

The verdict banner classifies the result:

| Score | Verdict | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| $\geq 0.7$ | **RESILIENT** | System absorbs faults and recovers |
| $0.4 - 0.7$ | **DEGRADING** | System is losing ground over time |
| $< 0.4$ | **COLLAPSING** | System cannot sustain operation |
